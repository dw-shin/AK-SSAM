## Topics for the final project
- [(Project 1)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dw-shin/AK-SSAM/blob/main/projects/project_1.ipynb) Solving heat equations with proper time discretizations 
	1. Complete the ipynb file for `Project 1`.
	1. Do the experiments with various time step sizes and $h$.
	1. Discuss the results.
- [(Project 2)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dw-shin/AK-SSAM/blob/main/projects/project_2.ipynb) Solving convection-diffusion equations using FEM and investigating what happens when convection is dominated 
	1. Complete the ipynb file for `Project 2`.
	1. Do the experiments with various diffusion coefficients ($\epsilon$).
	1. Discuss the results and find the reason why spurious oscillations occur when the convection is dominated ($\epsilon << 1$).
