# 2024 AJOU-KYUSHU SUMMER SCHOOL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS

---

This is a summer intensive course jointly organized by the Department of Mathematics at Ajou University and the IMI at Kyushu University, focusing on various topics on numerical analysis, partial differential equations, optimization, and their applications. It will be held at Kyushu University in 2024.

## Topics for the final project
- [(Project 1)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dw-shin/AK-SSAM/blob/main/projects/project_1.ipynb) Solving heat equations with proper time discretizations 
	1. Complete the ipynb file for `Project 1`.
	1. Do the experiments with various time step sizes and $h$.
	1. Discuss the results.
- [(Project 2)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dw-shin/AK-SSAM/blob/main/projects/project_2.ipynb) Solving convection-diffusion equations using FEM and investigating what happens when convection is dominated 
	1. Complete the ipynb file for `Project 2`.
	1. Do the experiments with various diffusion coefficients ($\epsilon$).
	1. Discuss the results and find the reason why spurious oscillations occur when the convection is dominated ($\epsilon << 1$).
